# <WorkDayScheduler-Challenge5>

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day. The app is designed to run in the browser. In this project, I learned how to use Bootstrap to create a CSS framework for the scheduler using the table elements. I also used JQuery and JavaScript.
